ATMs are automated machines intended for handling cash transactions, enabling customers to access their accounts at any hour. They offer services for withdrawing and depositing money, feature touchscreen interfaces, and present clear instructions to assist users. When using an ATM, customers insert their cards, and the machine displays relevant account information, allowing them to select their preferred payment method. For withdrawal amounts surpassing 10,000 units, supplementary authentication measures such as facial recognition or mobile one-time passwords (OTP) might be necessary.# intelrepo
